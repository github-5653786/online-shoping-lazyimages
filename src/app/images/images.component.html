                        Jeffrey Preston Bezos (/ˈbeɪzoʊs/;[a][3] né Jorgensen; born January 12, 1964) is an American
                        internet and aerospace entrepreneur, media proprietor, and investor. He is best known as the
                        founder, chief executive officer, and president of Amazon. The first centi-billionaire on the
                        Forbes
                        wealth index, Bezos was named the "richest man in modern history" after his net worth increased
                        to
                        $150 billion in July 2018.[4] In September 2018, Forbes described him as "far richer than anyone
                        else on the planet" as he added $1.8 billion to his net worth when Amazon became the second
                        company
                        in history to reach a market cap of $1 trillion.Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
                        raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in
                        electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related
                        fields from 1986 to early 1994.He founded the online retailer Amazon in late 1994 on a
                        cross-country road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore
                        and has since expanded to a wide variety of other e-commerce products and services, including
                        video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.
